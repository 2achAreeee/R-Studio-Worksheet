# Project Roles

- **Creator:** Brian Cooper
- **Interpreter:** Zeyan Huang
- **Orator 1:** Leonardo De Oliveira
- **Orator 2:** Thea Yang
- **Deliverer:** Shihang Liu

# Dataset

[Patient Survival Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/mitishaagarwal/patient)

# Initial Questions

- **Question 1:** Do certain diagnoses link with a specific heart rate range?
- **Question 2:** How good is the Glasgow Coma Scale during the first 24 hours as a prediction for survival rate?
- **Question 3:** Are there significant differences in survival rates (and potentially other health assessments) between the different locations prior to admittance to the ICU (accident/emergency, transfer, etc.)?
- **Question 4:** Does race have any relationship with survival rate?
- **Question 5:** Is there a positive relationship between bmi and survival rate? If there is, how strong is the correlation?
- **Question 6:** Is weight correlated the length of stay of the patient between hospital admission and unit admission?
- **Question 7:** Is there any relationship between gender and survival rate? 
- **Question 8:** Is the patientâ€™s respiratory rate (during the first 24 hours) correlated with the temperature measured (during the first 24 hours) ?
- **Question 9:** Is age has a positive correlation with survival rate? If yes, is there a negative correlation between the patients' lowest heart rate during the first 24 hours of their unit stay and their survival rate for patients who are at the same age?
- **Question 10:** Which disease has the lowest survival rate? Are different diseases have different survival rates in different age periods?
